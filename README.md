# TradingPlatform_test

You live on an island without money, deals are only done by trading, the leader of the island asked you to build a platform for users that will allow them to trade with each other.
All the products of the island have a value, we are using points as a currency.
Each deal will be made as a bid
Each product will have a minimum bidding price which will be its own value, but, sellers can accept products with a greater value than the value of the product.
E.g 1: If water = 1 point, glass = 2 points, shirt = 3 points so one can trade 2 glasses with water and a shirt, and add more items (the person who approves the bid can put more points than the bid itself)
E.g 2: If bread = 5 points and a cow = 6 points, if person1 sells bread for 5 points and person2 only has a cow and wants to trade his cow for the bread he can do it but he will not get any change
You need to create a user interface following the attached HTML files, and REST API(the island has no money but has a lot of REST APIs) according to the following demand, remember to add a little bit of documentation for each request 
HTML - Link
The system should be responsive
